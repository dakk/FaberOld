* move from Command design to BMessage design
* mixer entry values (extends a bslider to show an entry auto updated with slider changing)
* add support for multi channel tracks or study a trick to avoid this problem (like a group track). (In ardour each stereo track
is a double track with inverted pan)



DONE:
* fix shutdown fault
* pan support for each track
